**About**

Literature directory hosted on Heroku aimed at allowing users to keep track of their favorite books. By using the RESTful routes, users will be able to add, edit, and delete books. A Sign In functionality has been added, which includes a welcome message for current-users. This feature is fully funtional. However, it leaves room for additional current-user perks, such as possible favorites component in the future. 

To improve this project, I would like to add categories that the user add books to, such as 'Currently Reading', 'Have Read', and 'Want to Read'. This sections would be like shelves on a bookcase, and the user could scroll through to browse, add, delete, and edit to each shelf individually.
